Simple to use app that helps generate a mailing list from an Exchange account

Usage:

git clone https://github.com/zenchild/Viewpoint.git
edit Gemfile and point to local copy of Viewpoint (at time of writing master branch is what I needed)
bundle install #install gems, in my case I'm using a local copy of viewpoint
bundle exec bash -l #this will get you a bash session with current gems, use rvm if you want
copy settings.yml.example to settings.yml and add your settings
edit mailing_list.rb and set date range you want.  i goes day by day so that Exchange doesn't barf because you are trying to access too many records
ruby mailing_list.rb
edit cleanup.rb and filter however you want (i only wanted certain top level domains so that is what I filtered out)
ruby cleanup.rb

voila, clean_address.csv is ready to be used for a mailing list
