Simple to use app that helps generate a mailing list from an Exchange account

Usage:

git clone https://github.com/zenchild/Viewpoint.git
edit Gemfile and point to local copy of Viewpoint (at time of writing master branch is what I needed)
bundle install #install gems, in my case I'm using a local copy of viewpoint
bundle exec bash -l #this will get you a bash session with current gems, use rvm if you want
copy settings.yml.example to settings.yml and add your settings
